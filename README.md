# Echo Substat RNG Manipulation
This just clicks the tune button at the right time.
There are a lot of limitations, especially when we're looking for precision down to the milliseconds, but hopefully this makes it a bit more consistent.

## How to use:
Make sure you have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3124/) and [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html#command-line-interface) installed.

- Clone this repo
- Open a terminal in the directory
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Modify the config.json to configure the time patterns you want
  - Optionally you can also configure the keybinds
- Run `run.bat`
- Wait for the GUI to pop up
  - Ensure that "Enable Clicking" is checked when you want it to click
- Put your mouse over the "tune" button
- Then just wait
